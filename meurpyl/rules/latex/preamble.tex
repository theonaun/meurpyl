\section{Preamble}

Corporations are creatures of habit; they do today what they did yesterday because what they did yesterday worked. Sticking with convention has its benefits: it is stable, often predictable, and offers a level of comfort and control that constant change cannot provide. In most corporations, there needs to be a compelling and justfiable reason to deviate from the status quo.

This is often where Python runs into difficulty in the enterprise context.
