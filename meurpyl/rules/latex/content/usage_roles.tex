\section{Usage Roles}

	\subsection*{Introduction}

		The rules and controls that should exist for a Python are determined by the risks and benefits involved. These risks and benefits, in turn, are derived from: a) the inherent attributes of the Python language, and b) the manner in which the Python language is used. The inherent attributes of the Python lanugage are largely fixed, but the manner in which Python is use is anything but.

		An organization will likely have a multiplicity of use cases for Python encompassing everything from applications programming to data analysis. These use cases can conceptually be treated as a spectrum or as a group of discrete types of use cases. Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks--a spectrum sacrifices administrative efficiency because each use case must be approached individually; discrete groups of use cases sacrifice granularity because each use case must be shoehorned into a use case that it may or may not be suited to.

		For the purposes of these rules, discrete groups of use cases is demonstrably the better choice. Usage categories can be written in such a way as to cover broad areas of usage that share similar charactaristics. Additionally, items that do not fall within the criteria for inclusion in any other category can be shunted into a specialized cateogry for individualize treatment.

		MEURPyL imposes five arbitrary Usage Roles ("UR"):

		\begin{enumerate}
        	\item Data Exploration (DE)
        	\item Data Processing (DP)
        	\item System Adminstration (SA)
        	\item Systems Development (SD)
        	\item Unclassified Usage (UU)
        \end{enumerate}
