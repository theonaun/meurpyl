Model Enterprise Usage Rule for the Python Language (MERPyL)

Are we OK with public repositories if we can limit the packages?
PyPI
Anaconda.org

Are we OK with crippling Pip/Conda, and only allowing privileged users to install?

Are we OK with the fact that we cannot prevent people from using source code?

Do we need to review everything to what extent? Open source good enough


No repository required if:
a) you wrote it 
b) it is not run on a periodiic basis
c) the code's failure would not ruin anything ... and can be done otherwise.

If it is in a respository in must be reviewed yearly. License goes to the bank.
If it is used for mission critical code, must be reviewed and maintained.
Code must have sufficient documentation to ensure that someone unfamiliar with code should understand it.
