<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Python is an interpreted, general purpose programming language that excels in data analysis, systems administration, and a variety of other roles. Because of its flexibility and the speed at which it can be used to complete projects, Python is increasingly being used within the financial services sector. Python is unlike more traditional enterprise languages, such as COBOL, Java, and C#; consequently it has a unique risk profile that benefits from individualized treatment. The purpose of this document is to provide a model set of rules for the governance and use of the Python language in the financial services context.</p>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>Corporations are creatures of habit; they do today what they did yesterday (because what they did yesterday worked). Convention has its benefits: it is stable, predictable, and even comforting. It is not completely without cost, however. Companies that fail to innovate stagnate and die every day.</p>
<p>Enterprise Python shares these trade offs. Unlike COBOL, it does not have fifty years of enterprise usage. Unlike C#, it is not backed up with an army of software engineers and support staff to integrate the language within existing intrastructure. In its place, Python provides a fluid and expressive environment that is unparalelled for rapid development and data science.</p>
<p>Risk managers and information technology employees often recognize these strengths, but are hesistant to fully accept Python in their organizations without fuller understanding of the risks involved. In order to make Python more palatable at the enterprise level, some tradeoffs must be made. A measure of autonomy is sacrificed for the sake of control and oversight. Some flexibility is sacrificed for the sake of stability and uniformity. Empowerment is sacrificed for the sake of security and mitigating risk.</p>
<p>These rules use the following guiding principles to inform these trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The correct path should be the path of least resistance</strong>–employees are more likely to comply if the rules make it easy to do so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Arbitrary is better than indefinite</strong>–having bright line rules reduces confusion even if it does not always yield the right outcome.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make it as safe as it needs to be (but no safer)</strong>–nothing can be made completely safe, but things can be made completely useless.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the Model Enterprise Usage Rules for the Python Language (“MEURPyL” or “Meurpyl”) provides a model for a set of baseline standards governing the Python language. Meurpyl is just that: a baseline. It is not dogma that is intended to be adopted without question. Rather, it is intended to function as a base by which organizations can adapt Python for their own purposes–using what works and ignoring the rest.</p>
<h1 id="risk-profile">Risk Profile</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This section covers many basic details of the Python language; it may not be necessary for all readers.</p>
<p>Python is unlike other enterprise languages. For example, it is interpreted instead of compiled, it uses syntatically significant whitespace instead of braces, and it uses a virtual machine specific to the Python language.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>The largest difference between Python and other enterprise languages from a risk management perspective is that Python can be thought of as an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>,</sup></span> <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Computing languages can fall on a spectrum of those that are primarily interpreted (such as R and Python) and those that are primarily compiled (such as COBOL and C++). The difference is that compiled languages do a comparatively larger portion of any computation at the time of compilation, and have minimal runtime environments. Interpreted languages do most or all of the computations required at runtime. Both approaches have their advantages, and like other languages, Python is both compiled language and interpreted.</p>
